# Hacking-Toolbox
This is in heavy work, I'll update this readme later. Until then, I do not recommend you use this

Tools:

main.py:
1. Discord Spamming Tool(SelfBot):
A selfbot that does three things:
spams with "-spam"
pings all the roles in a guild with "-massroleping"
Dms eveyone that sends a message: ":wave: Why, hello there :wave:"
2. Discord Alt and token generator:
--THIS IS NOT FULLY AUTOMATIC--
It creats accounts and saves the token to tokens.txt, and the email and password to username_and_passwords.txt
You will need to do two things: 
Complete the catcha, and enter the date. When entering the date, do NOT press the confirm button, the script will.
3. Discord Token Checker:
Checks the tokens in the tokens.txt file

DISCUM.py:
--I do not recomend you use this(Yet)--
1. Discord Friend Spammer:
Spams the specified message in a DM with the bot, required the id of the DM.
2. Discord Guild Grabber:
Gets all of the guilds the account is in.
